`pyrep` (*Py*thon g*rep*) is a python script with which you can search
and also replace regular expressions in a collection of files.
Its functionality is similar to the perl script `plrep` from
https://github.com/vaeth/mv_perl/

To install this script, just copy it into your `$PATH`.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available over layman).
